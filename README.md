# Features

This SDK is intended to provide an easy way to filter for item in the latest feed file for a particular marketplace and category. It downloads the latest file and unzips it. It  filters the feed file for the given itemId and writes the filtered output to a file.
The item feed files provide a rich set of data regarding active ebay listings. The feed files for any supported marketplace can be downloaded through the Feed API V1.

This .NET SDK provides methods such as
* DownloadLatestFile(rangeValue, feedtype, categoryId, marketplaceId, zippedOutputFilename):
  It determines the latest file of the feedtype for the given marketplaceId and categoryId, and
  downloads the file in chunks of rangeValue.<br>
* Unzip(zippedOutputFilename, unzippedOutputFilename): It unzips the downloaded feed file.  <br>
* FilterByItem(itemId, unzippedOutputFilename, filteredOutputFilename): It downloads the latest file, unzips it, filters the feed file
  for the given itemId and writes the filtered output to a file.<br>

There are individual methods as well:
* CallGetFeedTypes : To get the list of feed types
* CallGetFiles : To get the list of files for a given feed type
* CallGetFile : To the file metadata
* CallGetAccess : To get the access configuration
* CallDownloadFile : To download the feed file

For more details on Feed V1 API, please refer to the [documentation](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/buy/feed/v1/static/overview.html).
